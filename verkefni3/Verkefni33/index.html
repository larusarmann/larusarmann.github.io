                McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, 
                serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across 37,855 outlets as of 2018. 
                Although McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they also feature chicken products, 
                breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. 
                In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food,
                the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. 
                The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, 
                as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to two reports published in 2018, 
                McDonald's is the world's second-largest private employer with 1.7 million employees (behind Walmart with 2.3 million employees).</p>

                McDonald's Corporation is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, 
                in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, 
                and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, 
                Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers.
                McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in early 2018.

                On May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name "McDonald's" with the description 
                "Drive-In Restaurant Services", which continues to be renewed. 
                By September 13, McDonald's, under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping, 
                double-arched "M" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. 
                Although the "Golden Arches" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, 
                when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.

                The present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955. 
                This was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall, although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. 
                Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the company's worldwide reach. 
                Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.</p>
